subset-selector
===============

Subset selection using IPython/Jupyter Notebook


Install
-------

        git clone https://github.com/blbradley/subset-selector
        cd subset-selector
        python setup.py install

Usage
-----

See [example notebook](examples/example.ipynb) and run it yourself for interactive use.

Notes
-----

* The figure navigation toolbar is overridden for every figure after using `SubsetSelector`. Would be nice if it only worked on a single figure.
